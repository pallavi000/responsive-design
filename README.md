Refer to this [link](https://pallavi000.github.io/fs16_2-responsive-design)(see 'Dark version') and create a similar webpage

## Requirements

1. Position the HTML elements using Flexbox and Grid system
2. Implement basic animations as shown in the webpage (hover effect,
active link styles, typing effect). You can modify the outlook of the effects
3. Deploy your web page, using the platform of your choice (For example, Github Pages).
4. This assignment requires the implementation of SASS.
5. Rewrite README file with good structure. Add unnecessary files and folders to `.gitignore`

This assignment only requires 1 static page. No JavaScript needed.
Font family and text content can be modified as your preferences.
The web page does not need to be fully responsive, but at least you should
have responsive scaling for Flexbox and Grid system.
